# My First Course on Convex Optimization
![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Doslim.My-First-Course-on-Convex-Optimization)

This repository contains lecture notes on convex optimization, including the following contents (to be updated):

- Part I: Review and Preliminaries
  1. Linear Algebra Review
  2. Linear Programming Review

- Part II: Theory
    1. Convex Sets
    2. Convex Functions
    3. Convex Optimization Problems
    4. Duality

- Part III: Algorithm
    1. Unconstrained minimization
    2. Interior-point Methods

The lecture notes are intended for the doctoral qualification exams in management science and engineering. We plan to upload related videos in the future. 

## Reference
1. We follow the structure of the famous textbook [*Convex Optimization*](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. 
2. We also borrow many contents from the course, *Advanced Operations Research*, presented by Prof. [Yong Liang](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1233/7254.htm) in Department of MS&E, Tsinghua University.
